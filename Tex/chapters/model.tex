\subsection{Gabriel- and Relative Neighborhood Graph}
\label{sec:graphtypes}
    The Gabriel Graph \cite{Gabriel1969} is a subgraph of the
    Delaunay Triangulation. Two nodes \(i\) and \(j\) with distance
    \(d_{ij}\) are connected with an edge if a circle with it's
    center on the middlepoint between \(i\) and \(j\) and radius
    \(r = \frac d 2\) contains no other nodes. This area will be
    called \emph{lune} in the following. See also Figure
    \ref{fig:lunes}.\\
    The Relative Neighborhood Graph \cite{Toussaint1980} is a
    subgraph of the Gabriel Graph. Two nodes \(i\) and \(j\) with
    distance \(d_{ij}\) are connected if no other node is in the
    \emph{lune}. The lune is defined as the intersection of two
    circles with radius \(r = d\) and centers on \(i\) and \(j\).
    See also Figure \ref{fig:lunes}.

                and Relative Neighborhood Graph]
                {Left: Lunes of Gabriel Graph (red) and Relative
                    Neighborhood Graph (blue and red). Middle:

                    dashed. Right: Example of a Relative
                    Neighborhood Graph. Periodic nodes are dashed.}

    To construct these graphs the simple way is to test for every
    pair of nodes for every node if it lies in the lune of the pair.
    That is of complexity \(O (n^3)\).\\
    To reduce the complexity one can first create a Delaunay
    Triangulation in complexity \(O (n \log n)\)
    \cite{Leach1992} and test the criterion for each edge, because
    the Delaunay Triangulation is a supergraph of both. But the
    implementation of a Delaunay Triangulation algorithm is not
    trivial and the generation of the graphs is not time critical in
    the scope of this bachelor thesis.\\
    So a tradeoff is to use basicly the simple method but only test
    the criterion for nodes which are near to the lune and abort if
    one node inside the lune is found. To determine which nodes are
    near the lune one can save the position of every node in a
    \emph{cell list} according to \cite{RNGCell} and just test the
    nodes in the cells which contain the lune.

\subsection{Model}
    The used model is a modified 2D Ising model where the sites are
    displaced nodes of a square lattice with periodic boundary
    conditions. The displacement is randomly gauss distributed with the
    standard deviation \(\sigma\). This \(\sigma\) is also called
    \emph{disturbance paramter} in the following.
    The hamiltonian of the Ising model is
    \(\hat{H} = \sum_{<i,j>}J_{ij}s_{i}s_{j}\)
    where \(<i,j>\) refers to by edges connected nodes.
    The edges are constructed according to the in section
    \ref{sec:graphtypes} defined rules. So that the lattice resembles a
    proximity graph. Each node \(i\) has a spin \(s_i = \pm 1\). Each
    edge has a weight \(J_{ij} = \exp (\alpha (1-d_{ij}))\) with the
    distance \(d_{ij}\) between the nodes \(i\) and \(j\). \(J\) is
    called \emph{interaction}.\\
    For \(\sigma = 0\) this is the standard Ising model with \(J = 1\).
