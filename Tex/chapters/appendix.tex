\section{Finite Size Effects at the Example of the Specific Heat}
In fig. \ref{fig:smeared_out_appendix} the specific heat
\[C = \frac{N}{T^2}\avg{\avg{E^2} - \avg{E}^2}\]
is plotted for different system sizes. The finite size effects are obvious.
The divergence is finite, and gets shallower with smaller \(L\). Besides
the maximum moves away from the critical temperature with smaller \(L\).
