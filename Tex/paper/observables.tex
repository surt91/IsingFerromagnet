Once the simulation reaches equilibrium after \(t_eq\) sweeps,
the magnetization per spin \(m\) and energy per spin \(E\) are measured
every \(\tau\) sweeps, where \(\tau\) denotes the autcorrelation time.
Also the two point finite-size correlation function \(\xi(x)\) \cite{} [TODO: formel]
at \(x=0\) and \(x=\frac{2\pi}{L}\) is measured for selected \(\sigma\).
